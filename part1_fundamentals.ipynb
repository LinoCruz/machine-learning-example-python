    "\n",
    "Concepts:\n",
    "- Input Variables.- features or predictors or independent variables.\n",
    "- Output Variable.- know as target variable, dependent variable or response variable.\n",
    "- Training set.- group of training instance or sample. \n",
    "- Cost function.- also known as error rate or value function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Rules-Based vs. Machine Learning\n",
    "######  The rules-based approach could fail because the target can change its behaviour to prevent the detection. Instead, the machine-learning approach is more cheaper because it learns form its own expereience and can also predict new kind of shapes of the target. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Supervised vs Unsupervised\n",
    "###### In supervised the AI agent has access to labels. In the unsupervised learning we don't have labels. \n",
