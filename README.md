# Machine Learning Project

This is a project with an applied machine-learning model on frauds with real credit-card data.

The data set couldn't be uploaded because of the size.

However this project can be review in two parts so far:

1. Part1_fundamentals.ipynb: This jupyter notebook only contains text explaining the main concepts on Machine Learning. 
2. Part2_project.ipynb: This jupyter notebook contains the project itself where dome models are applied to see which is the better fit to recognize the instances with fraud vs the non-fraud. 
You can see two models so far:
  * Logistic Regression
  * Random Forest 
Both are used with a supervised approach.
